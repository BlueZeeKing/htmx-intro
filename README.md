# HTMX Intro

This is my first introduction to using Rust to host a backend. It started as
learning [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and [Axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum)
but grew to use [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) for hosting and managing a
Postgres database. It also uses [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide) for user
authentication.
